# Snow Crash

## Project Overview

The "Snow Crash" project is a collection of challenges or levels, each containing a `flag` file and a `resources` directory with a `write-up.md` file. The goal of this project is to solve each level, document the solution in the corresponding `write-up.md`, and progress through the levels sequentially.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
levelXX/
  flag
  resources/
    write-up.md
```

- **`levelXX/`**: Represents a specific level in the challenge.
- **`flag`**: Contains the flag for the level.
- **`resources/write-up.md`**: Contains the solution or write-up for the level.

## Levels

The project includes the following levels:

- Level 00
- Level 01
- Level 02
- Level 03
- Level 04
- Level 05
- Level 06
- Level 07
- Level 08
- Level 09
- Level 10
- Level 11
- Level 12
- Level 13
- Level 14

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired level directory (e.g., `level00/`).
2. Solve the challenge and retrieve the flag.
3. Document the solution in the `resources/write-up.md` file.
4. Proceed to the next level.
